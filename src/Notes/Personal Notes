When constructing Fixtures, after declaring the appbundle entity path, you can pass a "unique string" as a name
of the table. e.g. Table name is "Production", you can use "Production_ / Production__" as a holder.

Alice 3.x no longer ships with a persistence layer, so this library provides one!
composer require --dev theofidry/alice-data-fixtures:^1.0@beta doctrine/orm:^2.5 doctrine/data-fixtures
To be used for pushing faker data to database after generating one using Alice/Faker

TWIG
Twig doesn't care if you have no specific field in the database, all it cares about is the getter specified propery
of the class even the data is not in the database.

{% %} - Do some actions / extend / block ; {{}} - just print.

DOCTRINE MIGRATIONS BUNDLE
Will let you see the query before applying it and the versions of altered , new , dropped database created.
You can revert or apply changes and it will only save the structure of the database not the whole data that lives in it.
More safer for migrating to production but definitely need to learn more on how it works.

404 EXCEPTIONS
If query does not return a match, just render an html 404 page.

DOCTRINE FIXTURES BUNDLE / FIXTURES / DUMMY DATA
Helps populate dummy data on the database for developers and easy testing.
Put this on the test environment on AppKernel.
Default Directory Path : src/AppBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/

NELMIO / ALICE
$bundles[] = new Nelmio\Alice\Bridge\Symfony\NelmioAliceBundle() for configuration

REQUEST IDS
Adding a method called getId to generate requests link for Production View.

FORMS
$form->handleRequest($request) ONLY HANDLES DATA for POST. If it's a GET it's just render the form but not submit it.
