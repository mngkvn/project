*Add js client side validation for faster error checking ??

**Tie the type on to ManyToOne form relationship.

**Deleted out AssertPhoneNumber ,@AssertPhoneNumber and change the column type from "phone_number" to string

*** Do not change the category names on database ex : b2b-business to B2B Business as some of the queries rely on it.
***Add find by company , name and email and sort by company email name
***Check if admin before adding the isActive field.
***Fix choose an option on edit when selected.( Added empty data and ternary operator to fix issue, need admin check)

***ADDED SETTERS ON ADMIN USERS FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY
!!!Using guard authenticator for login instead of the firewall
!!!Using a pathservice is easier to maintain than using $request->attributes->get('route');
